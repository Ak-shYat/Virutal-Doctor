    # Medical Workflow AI Agent

    This project implements a modular AI-powered medical workflow system using Python and LangChain to process patient symptoms, generate diagnoses, recommend medications, and coordinate follow-up care through a chain of specialized agents. The Medical Workflow AI Agent simulates a medical consultation pipeline using multiple AI agents. Each agent handles a specific task, from symptom analysis to follow-up recommendations. The system supports running the full workflow or individual agents via an interactive command-line interface.

    ## Features

    - **Interactive CLI**: Choose to run the full workflow or individual agents with user-provided inputs.
    - **Modular Agents**: Four specialized agents:
      - **General Doctor**: Analyzes symptoms and suggests possible conditions.
      - **Diagnosis**: Provides a likely diagnosis and recommends clinic/specialist types.
      - **Medication**: Suggests medications based on the diagnosis.
      - **Follow-Up**: Coordinates follow-up actions and monitoring tips.
    - **Error Handling**: Robust logging for API issues, missing inputs, or safety filter blocks.
    - **Extensible**: Easily add new agents or modify prompts.

    ## Tech Stack

    - **Python**: Core programming language.
    - **LangChain**: Framework for AI model integration and prompt templating.
    - **Google Generative AI (Gemini-1.5-Flash)**: Powers AI-driven medical analysis.
    - **python-dotenv**: Manages environment variables for secure API key handling.
    - **Logging**: Built-in Python logging for debugging and monitoring.

    ## Installation

    1. Clone the repository:
       ```bash
       git clone https://github.com/your-repo/medical-workflow-ai-agent.git
       cd medical-workflow-ai-agent
       ```

    2. Install dependencies:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```

    3. Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Google API key:
       ```
       GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
       ```

    4. Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.

    ## Usage

    Run the script to start the interactive CLI:
    ```bash
    python interactive_app.py
    ```

    ### Options

    1. **Run full workflow**: Input symptoms to process through all agents (General Doctor → Diagnosis → Medication → Follow-Up).
    2. **Run General Doctor Agent**: Input symptoms for possible conditions.
    3. **Run Diagnosis Agent**: Input a preliminary assessment for diagnosis and recommendations.
    4. **Run Medication Agent**: Input a diagnosis for medication suggestions.
    5. **Run Follow-Up Agent**: Input symptoms, assessment, diagnosis, and medications for follow-up recommendations.

    ### Example
    ```
    === Medical Workflow Interface ===
    Choose an option:
    1. Run full workflow
    2. Run General Doctor Agent
    3. Run Diagnosis Agent
    4. Run Medication Agent
    5. Run Follow-Up Agent
    Enter your choice (1-5): 1
    Enter patient symptoms: Patient reports yellowing of hair and nails, fatigue, and mild abdominal discomfort.
    ```

    ## Agents

    - **GeneralDoctorAgent**: Suggests 2-3 possible conditions with reasons based on symptoms.
    - **DiagnosisAgent**: Provides a likely diagnosis, clinic type, and specialist recommendation from a preliminary assessment.
    - **MedicationAgent**: Recommends 2-3 medications with roles, dosages, and schedules based on the diagnosis.
    - **FollowUpAgent**: Suggests follow-up actions and monitoring tips based on symptoms, assessment, diagnosis, and medications.

2. **Commit the Updated File**:
   - Replace the existing `README.md` in your repository with the above content.
   - Run the following commands in your terminal:
     ```bash
     git add README.md
     git commit -m "Update README.md with proper formatting"
     git push origin main
     ```
   - Replace `main` with your default branch name (e.g., `master`) if different.

3. **Check for Encoding Issues**: Ensure the file is saved with UTF-8 encoding. You can open the file in a text editor (like VS Code or Notepad++) and confirm the encoding. Save it as UTF-8 if needed.

4. **Verify on GitHub**: After pushing, visit your GitHub repository page to see if the README renders correctly. If it still looks off, it might be due to:
   - Hidden special characters or artifacts (e.g., from copying/pasting).
   - A corrupted file. In this case, create a new `README.md` file locally and paste the content again.

5. **Debugging Tip**: If the issue persists, you can temporarily simplify the README to a basic version (e.g., just a heading and a sentence) and commit it to isolate the problem.
